# OneCampusProj-ChicagoCrimeData_EDA
## My First Python Data Analytics Project

### Project Brief

Crime in Chicago has been worrisome to the Chicago PD. Reported crimes have been tracked on a daily basis since 2001
and have been provided in the project data file. The Chicago PD would like to drastically reduce the spate of violent crimes
reported in the city. Being effective involves knowing crime patterns and where they are likely to occur.

It also involves equipping the Police Department appropriately. 
They have recruited you to conduct full data analytics and uncover insights from the data
that can be used to effectively prepare for and respond to crimes. They are interested in gleaning any insights
that can help them determine What type of crimes to prepare for, Where these crimes are most likely to occur,
What days of the week and periods to expect these crimes

### Task

Conduct a complete data analytics study and from your analytics, advise the Chicago PD accordingly
